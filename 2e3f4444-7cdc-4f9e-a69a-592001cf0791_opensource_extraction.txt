MUHAMMAD NU\u2019AIM BIN ISHAK \n \n \nWELCOME TO THE OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY POSTING \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nOtorhinolaryngology (ORL), also commonly known as Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery (ENT), is a \nregional specialty involving medicine and surgery of the head and neck. The ORL posting is three \nweeks long and is conducted in the 8th semester. \nDuring the ORL posting, students should learn the basics of ORL and acquire the skills to gather \nconcise, relevant, and appropriate histories in ORL disorders. Students should also acquire the skills \nto perform appropriate ORL examinations and procedures, diagnose common ORL diseases, and \nexecute appropriate management plans. \nThe teaching and learning methods  include lectures, e-learning and tutorials , seminars, case-based \ndiscussions, and skills lab activities. Clinical placement in the hospital is also part of the program, \nincluding attachments in the ORL specialist clinic, ward, and operation theatre. \nAt the end of the posting, students should be able to describe the relevant clinical anatomy and \nphysiology of the ear, nose, and throat, and apply the principles of ORL in history taking, physical \nexamination, formulating diagnoses, selecting relevant inv estigations, and planning the appropriate \nmanagement of common ORL diseases. Additionally, students should be able to perform common \ntechniques, basic examinations, and procedures in ORL. Furthermore, students should demonstrate \nprofessionalism, uphold medical ethics, and possess good communication skills. \n \n \n  "}, {"page_number": 3, "text": " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSTUDENT GUIDE YEAR 4 Page 5 BACHELOR OF MEDICINE AND \nPEJABAT PENTADBIRAN MBBS BACHELOR OF SURGERY \nLEARNING OUTCOME: \n \nAt the end of three weeks of ORL posting, students should be able to: \n \nCLO1: Analyse the fundamental medical science in providing diagnosis and proposing a management plan \nfor common ORL problems.  \n \nCLO2: Perform fundamental history taking and examination to provide diagnosis and propose a management \nplan for common ORL problems. \n \n \n \nOUTLINES OF THE COURSE CONTENT \n \nDuring the three weeks of ORL posting, there will be various teaching activities which includes: \n \na.
